# count-game

This game utilizes [CREATEJS](http://createjs.com/) a modular suite of libraries which enable rich interactive HTML 5 content.

Some game assets were created in Adobe Animate CC as a HTML Canvas project and exported as a JavaScript library. *count-game-graphics.js*

The game logic is coded in JavaScript ES6 and I have included a compiled version created with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for older browsers.   

## Retina and touch support!
Has sound on click(touch) adjust your volume!
